This file was written for release 1.5 of DGD, Dworkin's Game Driver.

DGD is a rewrite from scratch of the LPMud server.  It runs on Windows, MacOS
and many versions of Unix.  The source repository for DGD can be found at:

    https://github.com/dworkin/dgd

DGD's home page is at:

    http://www.dworkin.nl/dgd/


This distribution is organized as follows:

bin		Installation binaries will be created here (Unix).
doc		Documentation, still very incomplete.
mud		A place to put the mudlib.
src		Where the source of DGD resides, and where you issue your
		`make' command on Unix.
src/host/*	Subdirectories for various platform-dependent files.
tmp		The place where temporary files, such as the swap file, are
		created by DGD.

See the file doc/Platforms for help on compiling DGD on various platforms.
Also consult the src/host/*/README file for your platform, if there is one.
