NAME
	send_datagram - send a message on the datagram channel

SYNOPSIS

DESCRIPTION
	Send a message on the datagram channel of an udp port object.
	Before a datagram can be sent or received, the object must open
	an udp port. This port can be used for sending and receiving udp
	packets to and from multiple hosts at the same time.

NOTES
	This version of the kfun is only used when the network extensions are
	enabled.
