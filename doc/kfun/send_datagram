NAME
	send_datagram - send a message on the datagram channel

SYNOPSIS
	int send_datagram(string message, string ip, int port)


DESCRIPTION
	Send a message on the datagram channel of an udp port object.
	Before a datagram can be sent or received, the object must open
	an udp port. This port can be used for sending and receiving udp
	packets to and from multiple hosts at the same time.

ERRORS
	An error will result if the current object has no open udp port

NOTES
	This kfun is only used when the network extensions are enabled.
	When not using the network extensions, see send_datagram instead.
