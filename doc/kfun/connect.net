NAME
	connect - initiate a tcp connection

SYNOPSIS
	void connect(string ipnumber, int port, varargs string protocol)


DESCRIPTION
	Initiate a telnet or tcp connection to the specified host and port,
	and associate the connection with this object when it is established.
	The protocol may be "telnet" or "tcp", or it may be omitted to
	default to "tcp".

	When the connection succeeds, open() will be called in obj.  If it
	fails or times out, close() will be called in obj.  After the
	connection is established, obj will be a normal user object.

ERRORS
	An error will result if the object was already has a connection,
	port, or editor associated with it.
	If the number of existing port and connection objects is equal
	to the value of status()[ST_UTABSIZE], calling connect() results
	in an error.

NOTES
	This kfun is only active when the network extensions are enabled.
