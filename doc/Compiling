A few useful notes for compiling DGD

DGD's build process is very simple, and doesn't have
a configure script.  Platforms are detected in
src/Makefile.

DGD can be compiled on Unix-like systems and on Windows.  See
src/host/win32/README for additional information regarding
the Windows build.

There are a few things you can enable/disable by adding the
proper defines to the Makefile on Unix systems, or to your
project on Visual Studio.


SLASHSLASH		      C++ style // comments in LPC code.

NETWORK_EXTENSIONS	      Enable extended network functionality
			      (outgoing connections, opening ports
			      from LPC code)

NOFLOAT			      Compile without host floats (LPC floats will
			      still work).

CLOSURES		      Function pointers, implemented as a builtin
			      type.  See doc/builtin for information
			      about adding builtin types.
			      CLOSURES allows taking the address of a
			      function with &func(), and calling the
			      function that a function pointer refers to
			      with (*func)().  When creating a pointer to
			      a function, function arguments may be
			      included: &func("foo").  More function
			      arguments can be added when the function is
			      called, or in constructing a new pointer:
			      &(*func)("bar")

CO_THROTTLE		      Enables callout throttling.  Set it to the
			      maximum number of callouts to run per I/O
			      task.  This can be useful for preventing
			      callout bombs from jamming your mud.

TYPEOFDETAIL     Allows the KFUN 'typeof' to differentiate
                 builtin types as more than simply
                 objects.  Adds to types.h in the
                 standard include directory for LPC.
                 See information on builtin types for more details.
